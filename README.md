# jay4digital.github.io
Harvey Nash Project

This project is about reading in a csv document into python and making use of the information on the document.
An empty list was created in python and the contents of the csv file was copied into the list, making it python readable.
The file contains information in rows and columns in csv format. This information is arranged/displayed according to certain requirements.
The back end part of the  project is written in python, while the front end was done in html and css. One of the requirements is for the data to be displayed in a web browser via hosting.
The programme was written using different functions to represent the different requirements, and tested by running the python shell with the correct attributes.

The project has a backend and frontend part. The website was hosted on github, and can be accessed directly via my username address, which is jay4digital.github.io
The github address contains all the files and folders i created for the project. It contains both the frontend and backend files.
You can access just the frontend directly by typing in jay4digital.github.io, and if you want to access all the files, it can be done by just logging into github and going to my user repository of jay4digital.

The css files, csv files, python(py) files, txt files, html files can all be seen and opened and examined. In the github directory with the files, it can be seen that there are two html files, index.html and Nashfrontend.html
They are both the same file, i had to add the index.html file because the hosting only recognises the index. html name as the html file.
